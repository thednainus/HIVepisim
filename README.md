# R package to simulate network with migrations

HIVepisim uses the [R package EpiModel](http://www.epimodel.org/) to simulate networks. 
The aim is to get a transmission matrix for simualtions using phylodynamics.

## Notes

- I still need to add a time point in which diagnostics will start to happen. At the moment it can happen from the very beginning of the simulation. 

- You can find code [here](https://github.com/thednainus/HIVepisim/blob/master/Analyses/MSM_Demog_Migration.R) to run a sample analyses.
